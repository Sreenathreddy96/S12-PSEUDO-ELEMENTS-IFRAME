      Chernobyl disaster, accident in 1986 at the Chernobyl nuclear power
      station in the Soviet Union, the worst disaster in the history of nuclear
      power generation.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The April 1986 disaster at the Chernobyla nuclear power plant in Ukraine
      was the product of a flawed Soviet reactor design coupled with serious
      mistakes made by the plant operatorsb. It was a direct consequence of Cold
      War isolation and the resulting lack of any safety culture.The accident
      destroyed the Chernobyl 4 reactor, killing 30 operators and firemen within
      three months and several further deaths later. One person was killed
      immediately and a second died in hospital soon after as a result of
      injuries received. Another person is reported to have died at the time
      from a coronary thrombosisc. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) was originally
      diagnosed in 237 people onsite and involved with the clean-up and it was
      later confirmed in 134 cases. Of these, 28 people died as a result of ARS
      within a few weeks of the accident. Nineteen more workers subsequently
      died between 1987 and 2004, but their deaths cannot necessarily be
      attributed to radiation exposured. Nobody offsite suffered from acute
      radiation effects although a significant, but uncertain, fraction of the
      thyroid cancers diagnosed since the accident in patients who were children
      at the time are likely to be due to intake of radioactive iodine
      falloutm,9. Furthermore, large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and
      beyond were contaminated in varying degrees. See also sections below and
      Chernobyl Accident Appendix 2: Health Impacts.<mark>
        The Chernobyl disaster was a unique event and the only accident in the
        history of commercial nuclear power where radiation-related fatalities
        occurrede. The design of the reactor is unique and in that respect the
        accident is thus of little relevance to the rest of the nuclear industry
        outside the then Eastern Bloc. However, it led to major changes in
        safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly between East
        and West before the end of the Soviet Union</mark
      >. Former President Gorbachev said that the Chernobyl accident was a more
      important factor in the fall of the Soviet Union than Perestroika – his
      program of liberal reform. The Chernobyl site and plant.It is estimated
      that all of the xenon gas, about half of the iodine and caesium, and at
      least 5% of the remaining radioactive material in the Chernobyl 4 reactor
      core (which had 192 tonnes of fuel) was released in the accident. Most of
      the released material was deposited close by as dust and debris, but the
      lighter material was carried by wind over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and to
      some extent over Scandinavia and Europe. The casualties included
      firefighters who attended the initial fires on the roof of the turbine
      building. All these were put out in a few hours, but radiation doses on
      the first day caused 28 deaths – six of which were firemen – by the end of
      July 1986. The doses received by the firefighters and power plant workers
      were high enough to result in acute radiation syndrome (ARS), which occurs
      if a person is exposed to more than 700 milligrays (mGy) within a short
      time frame (usually minutes). Common ARS symptoms include gastrointestinal
      problems (e.g. nausea, vomiting), headaches, burns and fever. Whole body
      doses between 4000 mGy and 5000 mGv within a short time frame would kill
      50% of those exposed, with 8000-10,000 mGy universally fatal. The doses
      received by the firefighters who died were estimated to range up to 20,000
      mGy.
